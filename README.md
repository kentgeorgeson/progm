Open Source Programme Management Tool on Meteor/React/MongoDB

This is my first app to learn Meteor with React and MongoDB.

The intent is to provide a basic Program Management application that allows monitoring of tasks assigned 
to an initiative and a group of initiatives to be managed as a Program of Work.

Definitely a work in progress, but stay tuned for further commits.
